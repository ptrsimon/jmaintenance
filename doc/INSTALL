Installation instructions - jmaintenance

The following commands install jmaintenance (run them as root):
    jmdir="/usr/sbin/jmaintenance"
    mkdir -v $jmdir
    cd to source directory (src subdirectory of an archive)
    cp -v *.bash $jmdir
    chown -v root:root $jmdir/*
    chmod -v 755 $jmdir/*
    ln -vs $jmdir/main.bash /usr/sbin/maintenance

Now you can run it by typing "maintenance" in single user mode.

NOTE 1: these instrutions do not contain installation instructions for documentation like manual pages.
NOTE 2: to ease the installation, an installer script is being developed.
NOTE 3: these commands violate the FSH standards (directory under /usr/sbin),
	the next release will be installable under /opt or any other directory as well.
NOTE 4: if you need to install it elsewhere now, modify the $SCRIPTPATH variable in main.bash.
